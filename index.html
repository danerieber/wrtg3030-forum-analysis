							The BBC’s article briefly describes the situation and then presents data showing that a
							significant percentage of student’s grades were lower than their teachers’ estimates. They
							also outline how this system benefitted private schools, since their history of higher
							performance meant that their students’ grades were not lowered to the same degree as public
							schools. This evidently fails high-performing students at low-performing schools, whose
							grades would likely be more accurate within the context of all UK students rather than just
							one school.<br>
							<br>
							The article wraps up by covering the government’s reversal of the decision. Finally, it
							presents a potential new problem of “grade inflation” due to the teacher-assigned grades
							flying above school averages. They predict that there may now be a strain on universities
							with the influx of students who can qualify for their programs.

							The scholarly article focused its attention on surveying affected students to gather their
							opinions on the fairness of exam cancellations and calculated grades. After providing
							background information, the paper explores student sentiments, taking into account patterns

							<br>
							It seemed that many students attributed the unfairness to structural inequalities in the

							The BBC’s self-description encapsulates what people ultimately expect from a large,
							responsible news outlet. While “impartial and independent” may be nearly impossible to
							enforce uniformly throughout their organization, their inclusion of their purpose to
							“entertain” may serve as a testament to their transparency -- it is not in their interest to

							Arguably, the juxtaposition of entertainment and education in their description may indicate

							The Open Science Framework is a product of COS (Center for Open Science). COS is very vague
							with their descriptions which are, in reality, more of mission statements
							instead. The goals outlined in the statements speak to the nature of the content that one
							would expect to find on their platform: open, collaborative, yet diligent research.<br>
							<br>
							It seems that openness and integrity may be counterintuitive, specifically for the
							scientific community. The means of discourse and publication within science are typically
							reserved for those that prove themselves qualified enough to engage in its language and
							methodology. This usually has the side effect that only properly conducted studies make
							their way into the spotlight. It can be argued, though, that COS’s emphasis on collaboration
							-- treating each project not as owned by the author but as owned by the community -- can
							remediate the faults of open publication, since the reliability of the research is
							everyone’s responsibility. In addition, opening scientific publication to the public should
							not decrease the competitiveness of top scientists who are attuned to the scholarly
							discourse, and it should rather draw attention to the quality of their work in reference to
							other, less disciplined public work.<br>
							<br>
							Whether or not OSF’s openness actually fosters integrity, perhaps papers from their website

						<hr>
						<p class="card-text">
							To compare the two forums, consider publishing a work originally from one forum to the other
							forum -- how successful would it be? Would a reader of the BBC care about, or even
							understand, a painfully thorough rundown of every finding leading to the scientific
							conclusions they’re interested in? Would a reader of OSF papers want more information to
							substantiate the claims made in news articles?<br>
							<br>
							A news article published to COS would likely be skipped by the majority of readers, as news
							articles are typically just a composite of existing facts or findings that fail to provide
							new information. The only exception to this is current events in which the news provides the
							information. In research, current events are typically studied in reference to a collection
							of similar events rather than just the most recent event itself, so these articles would
							still likely be irrelevant on OSF. Scientific publications do not exist to grab your
							attention, so entertainment and public reception is not of concern to readers or
							writers.<br>
							<br>
							Likewise, a study on OSF wouldn’t see much love on the BBC. Most people probably find the
							biggest barrier for reading such a paper is the time commitment. In fact, this very analysis
							is much longer than the BBC’s article itself, because this is not a summary of existing
							analysis, but the actual analysis itself. Running through reasoning takes more effort than
							people are willing to tackle.<br>
							<br>
							That is not to say that lack of reasoning is a bad thing. If you were to grab an atlas of
							your city, find the nearest McDonald’s, chart all major roads in its proximity, obtain data
							on traffic conditions and speed limits, gather information about the weather forecast, and
							finally conduct a case study on the timing of the traffic lights and the methods needed to
							avoid stops, then you could undoubtedly find the fastest possible method in which to reach
							the nearest McDonald’s. Or, you could trust that Google Maps has done all of that already
							and even done it well enough to get you there very quickly, and you can happily enjoy your
							FDA-approved Big Mac -- that is unless you would rather study its safety for human
							consumption yourself.<br>
							<br>
							Google Maps and the FDA not only prove themselves trustworthy as
							authorities, but also prove themselves as authorities due to their record of
							trustworthiness. It is with an almost insane (yet commendable) distrust of authority that a
							reader of the BBC would require a totality of reasoning and evidence rather than trust the
							source as an authority on accurate information reporting. This is why consumers of
							mainstream media don’t care about science unless they want to, and if they want to, they are
							keen to get more information elsewhere (such as Neil deGrass Tyson’s
							Twitter<sup>1</sup>).<br>
